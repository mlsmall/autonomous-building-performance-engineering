# Autonomous Multi-Agent Generative AI System for Real-Time Building Performance Engineering

This agentic network marks a significant shift in building performance modeling: the first autonomous multi-agent system that combines engineering calculations with generative AI to automate complex engineering decisions.

This isn't just another:
- "AI-powered" recommendation system
- LLM chatbot "researcher" giving generic summaries
- Static building energy calculator 
- Basic performance metrics tool

## What Makes It Different:
- Engineering calculations based on science, not LLM guesses
- Multi-agent system that explains how building design choices affect energy use, costs, and performance
- Interactive design guidance that doesn't just show problems, but provides better solutions
- Integrates international energy codes and standards
- Replaces frustrating energy management tools with natural conversation
